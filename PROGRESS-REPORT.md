# FlippersLog Development Progress Report
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Session:** BugFix Round 1 + Round 2 (In Progress)

---

## COMPLETED WORK - BugFix Round 1

### Issue 1: Quick Select Menu Not Auto-Populating with User Tables ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE and TESTED
**Commits:** ae2d769, 90aa134

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced `getSampleTables()` with `getTables()` to show real user tables
- Added `useFocusEffect` hook to refresh tables when screen regains focus
- Implemented fallback logic: show samples only for new users with no saved tables
- Added 3 comprehensive tests verifying all scenarios

**Files modified:**
- `app/manual-entry.tsx` - Updated imports, state, and table loading logic
- `__tests__/manual-entry-user-tables.test.tsx` - New test file (91 lines)
- `__tests__/manual-entry-flipper-icon.test.tsx` - Updated mock setup

**Test results:** 98/98 tests passing

---

### Issue 2: Replace Game Controller Icon with Pinball Flippers Icon ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE and TESTED
**Commits:** ae2d769

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced Ionicons game-controller with custom `pinball-flippers.png` image asset
- Removed unnecessary `@expo/vector-icons` dependency from manual entry screen
- Replaced close button Ionicons with Unicode "×" character
- Added `clearButtonText` style for proper formatting

**Files modified:**
- `app/manual-entry.tsx` - Icon and close button changes

**Test results:** 98/98 tests passing

---

## COMPLETED WORK - BugFix Round 2

### Task 1: Remove Manufacturer Field from Type Definition ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE and CODE REVIEWED
**Commit:** fd0255f

**What was done:**
- Removed `manufacturer?: string;` from Table interface in types/index.ts
- Verified type system and tests still work

**Implementation approach:**
- Single file change (types/index.ts)
- Type changes cascade through TypeScript system
- Subsequent tasks handle removing references from code

**Test results:** 98/98 tests passing

---

### Task 2: Remove Manufacturer from Storage Service ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE and CODE REVIEWED
**Commit:** 053a253

**What was done:**
- Removed manufacturer field from all 3 sample tables in `getSampleTables()`
- Updated test assertion to check `year` field instead of `manufacturer`
- Verified all manufacturer references removed from storage.ts

**Implementation approach:**
- Plan was slightly inaccurate (assumed addTable signature change needed, but Task 1 made it obsolete)
- Subagent correctly identified actual work needed (sample tables only)
- Demonstrated good judgment adapting plan to actual code state

**Test results:** 98/98 tests passing

---

### Task 3: Remove Manufacturer from Manual Entry UI ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE and CODE REVIEWED
**Commits:** 29e4c43

**What was done (TDD):**
- Created test file with 2 tests (RED phase)
- Tests verified they would fail with manufacturer field present
- Removed manufacturer state variable
- Removed manufacturer from selectTable function
- Removed manufacturer input field from UI (entire View block)
- Removed manufacturer from saveTable call
- Cleaned up clear button handler

**Implementation approach:**
- Strict TDD: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Created 2 new tests verifying removal
- All 5 changes needed to fully remove manufacturer

**Files modified:**
- `app/manual-entry.tsx` - Multiple targeted removals
- `__tests__/manual-entry-no-manufacturer.test.tsx` - New test file (2 tests)

**Test results:** 100/100 tests passing (98 original + 2 new)

---

## WORK IN PROGRESS - BugFix Round 2

### Remaining Tasks (5 of 8)

**Task 4:** Fix "unknown" table display in edit screen
- Issue: Edit screen shows "Table: Unknown" for manually entered scores
- Root cause: tableName not properly loaded or stored
- Approach: Ensure tableName saved with scores, handle legacy tableId format

**Task 5:** Add lastUsedDate tracking to tables
- Goal: Track when tables were last used
- Purpose: Enable sorting tables by recency for quick select

**Task 6:** Limit quick select to 7 most recent tables
- Current: Shows all tables unbounded
- Goal: Show only 7 most recent tables, sorted by lastUsedDate

**Task 7:** Add text matching and autocomplete
- Current: No text filtering on table input
- Goal: Filter tables by partial text match, autocomplete on single match

**Task 8:** Investigate photo storage behavior
- Question: How are photos stored? Are they duplicated?
- Goal: Understand storage mechanism and optimize if needed

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 1. Manufacturer Field Removal
**Decision:** Removed completely from type system and UI
**Reasoning:** Not needed, simplifies data model and reduces storage

### 2. Ionicons Removal
**Decision:** Replaced with custom image asset + Unicode character
**Reasoning:** Removed unnecessary dependency, improved brand identity with pinball-specific icon

### 3. Quick Select Architecture
**Decision:** Load all user tables, sort by recency, limit to 7
**Reasoning:** Simple, efficient, provides good UX with most recent tables visible

### 4. Table Name Fallback
**Decision:** Handle both `tableName` (new) and `tableId` (legacy) formats
**Reasoning:** Ensures backward compatibility with existing data

## NEXT STEPS

### Before Manual Verification
1. ✅ All work committed locally to main branch
2. ✅ All tests passing (100/100)
3. ✅ Code reviews completed for all 3 tasks
4. ✅ Documentation updated

### Manual Verification Needed
1. Test Quick Select functionality:
   - Verify sample tables show for new users
   - Verify real user tables appear after saving a score
   - Verify tables refresh when returning to screen

2. Test Manufacturer Removal:
   - Verify manufacturer field is gone from manual entry
   - Verify scores save without manufacturer
   - Verify no errors in console

3. Test Icon Changes:
   - Verify pinball flippers icon displays correctly
   - Verify clear button (×) works properly

### After Manual Verification (Planned)
1. Continue with Tasks 4-8 (5 remaining tasks)
2. Code review each task before moving to next
3. Final comprehensive review of all changes
4. Push to remote when all work verified locally
